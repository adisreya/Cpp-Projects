# Crowd Momentum Challenge Mode

This repository contains my solution to the **Software Engineering Simulation** by Forage.  
It includes two main components:

### 1. Game Match System (Crowd Momentum)
A C++ system modeling momentum in a sports game using object-oriented design.  
It features classes like `GameMatch`, `MomentumMeter`, `Player`, `Crowd`, and more.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Features:**
- Momentum meter logic influenced by crowd and plays
- Player morale and crowd energy adjustments
- Event-driven updates and UI interaction (simulated)
